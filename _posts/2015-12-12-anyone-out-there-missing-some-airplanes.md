description: "Three 747-200s are sitting on the ground at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), waiting to be claimed by their owner, but no one has come forward to collect them. Airport officials are searching for the rightful owners, but it would appear the aging aircraft - two in passenger configuration and one a freighter - have been abandoned, since they've been on the tarmac for more than a year."
