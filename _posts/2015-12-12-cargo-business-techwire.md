description: 'Engineered Rigging unveiled its new Power Slide System, which it says delivers a safe, simple and efficient way to move overweight, oversized loads in tight quarters. Comprised of skid shoes, which are powered by hydraulic push/pull cylinders over high-strength flat-topped track, Power Slide was created to move components such as turbines, generators, transformers, vessels and motors, especially when space limitations and cost preclude using a crane.'
